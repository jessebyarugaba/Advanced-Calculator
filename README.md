# Advanced-Calculator
Calculator built using javascript that utilises the power of sine, cos, tan, log and other miscellaneous mathematical functions. I built it because most people make calculators with basic arithmetics.
I have to code it as best as i can from scratch and did not follow any tutorial for this.
